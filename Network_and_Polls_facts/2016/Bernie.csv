The entire election I watch the\n corporate media manipulates the narrative of Bernie Sanders in a way that was beneficial to the plutocracy.

And I'm sorry you're such a short-sighted idiot who\n lacks the capacity to actually comprehend something for but the most important thing into fixing this country is\n getting Americans informed. And the fact that the corporate media has been spewing propaganda for Hillary Clinton\n this entire fucking time, I don't think it's the smartest thing to validate that shit by voting her into office. And I'm\n sorry you're such a fucking idiot that you can't comprehend that Hillary Clinton winning the election will bring a huge\n level of passivity to the entire population of America and for 4 more years nothing will get done because she is such a\n piece of shit candidate that we will not take back the Senate.

I mean I bet\n you are such a fucking idiot that you don't even comprehend that one of the main objectives of the government is to\n put people into a passive position of ignorance, because ignorant people are vastly easier to lead. That's literally been\n the Clintons mo since day fucking one. If we have any hope of changing the government or possibly combating climate\n change to actually save the fucking world, you have to get people out of their apathetic bubble and sadly you need\n extreme examples to do that.

Why did Bernie endorse Hillary now?\n A. They threatened to completey shut him out of the\n convention if he didn't\n Q. Couldn't he have said screw them and go and fight at\n the convention anyway?\n A. No. Hillary has more delegates, Superdelegates, and\n supporters on the DNC rules committee.

All the leverage he has gained\n up to this point would be gone\n Q. So wait, Bernie DIDN'T quit today?\n A. No. He had to say she won the primary, he endorses\n her and will help the party defeat Trump, yadda yadda\n but he DID NOT concede. There is a very big and\n important difference. Had he conceded, all of his\n delegates would go to Hillary and he would no longer be\n an option for nominee\n Q. So Bernie can actually still win??\n A. YES. And if he wasn't still TRYING to win, he would\n have conceded. The ONLY option he had to get to the\n convention with his delegates behind him and have a\n chance to still win was to do what he did today. He is\n not a traitor. He didn't sell us out.

We'd\n been together 12 years. High school sweethearts. We both campaigned f\n Obama (twice) and had that bright-eyed idealism inherent in 20-somethings\n looking for ""change we could believe in\n But I couldn't do it for Bernie. Maybe growing old also meant growing cold,\n because the cynic in me would not let me support him. How? The guy is a\n fucking washout. Hasn't accomplished anything. All he can do is talk and talk\n and talk about shit but he has no idea how to implement\n That's not the point,"" kept saying\n she ""It's about affecting change\n Change? If a guy like Obama couldn't affect change, how could this guy?\n Fuck that\n At first it wasn't even on the radar that we were seeing a rift. Our\n conversations were still robust, we still had our time. We avoided watching\n news or anything remotely election-related together. But it wasn't enough\n She started campaigning for Bernie here in Colorado, normally a swing state\n but when it comes to primaries, it's anti-establishment all the way. l started\n being surrounded by assholes who thought they knew what was good for me\n and everybody else entirely based on what this schmuck fed them. She\n dragged me to a party with a bunch of these schmucks, and trying to have a\n conversation with them was impossible\n never back down (a personality\n light, l know) and at some point l napped at this bernie bro asshole who\n called me a Republican ""who didn't realize l was one."" Chewed him out\n tormed out of the party\n All downhill since then. She wouldn't talk to me for a few days after because\n embarassed her. We stopped having sex (the last time we did was a few\n weeks before that party). The first primaries/caucuses rolled around, seemed\n ke had a little momentum, and oh my fuck did she run away with it.\n actually secretly unfollowed her on facebook (not unfriended\n just didn't want\n to see her stupid shit anymore). The big primaries came and went, New\n York, etc. and it was obvious she was getting a bit unstable. She jus\n couldn't handle not having her way in an election after a decade of getting\n just that. And I won't lie, l threw out the snark pretty heavy\n When it became obvious he wasn't going to win, she became fanatical\n Refused to believe it. Thought he was the messiah and that the world was\n conspiring against him (and her). I never thought she had mental illness until\n then\n We started having huge, all-out arguments, mostly about why l was\n supporting Hillary. She really thinks Hill is the devil incarnate, and anyone\n who supports her has a moral defect. We dredged irrelevant shit up from the\n past just to hurt each other\n Finally, the breaking point came a few weeks ago\n came home from work\n her car wasn't in the driveway. When I opened the door, the dog didn't greet\n me. She took him. Along with pretty much anything of value that we shared\n don't know how she did it so quickly. She must have arranged the mover\n days in advance and had help from someone. Who knews, maybe that\n bernie bro from the party who was seeing her on the side\n All that was left of her was a note she left on the dining room table. It was in\n her beautiful, flowing handwriting, the kind she used when we wrote notes to\n each other in high school. With my eyes heavy with tears I sat down, and\n started reading. It said\n Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken\n nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nugget\n out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the\n door on her\n m so distressed right now I don't know what to do. didn't\n mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results this\n year. feel like I'm going to explode.

It celebrates memes as a higher art form. It will show how they\n have moved a long way from websites such as Reddit and 4chan, and how\n they are used as communication across cultures. It will explore memes as\n an artistic practice that relate to people in a socio-political (Bernie and\n Hilary) and creative (Doge) way. It will include female meme collectives,\n colloquial meme sites, meme archives and gold mines. It will illustrate the\n transition from a simple 'internet meme' to memes that have transferred\n from URL into IRL. They will no longer be viewed as poor taste or low\n culture but portrayed as the most democratic art form, similar to folk art\n Fellow meme appreciators have sent in their favourite memes, or created\n their own, with a caption explaining what a meme means to them. The\n female collective\n are creating meme inspired pants for the\n exhibition, whilst Instagram artists\n and\n s have\n made original memes especially for What Do You Meme?\n The exhibition will raise curatorial questions, as to how something as fluid\n as an ""internet meme' will work outside of the internet, will it lose its\n meaning and purpose IRL? Will the memes included in the exhibition\n become dated as the internet flows on, dropping one thing and picking up\n the next? Will memes ever be taken seriously in the art world? However,\n one thing is for certain, What Do You Meme? will create an insight into the\n world of memes, encapsulating the most dank of its kind\n Above all else What Do You Meme? looks to much celebrate memes as a\n many light-hearted, such humorous part of the Internet that cannot go\n ignored",facepalm,imgur,07/3/16 22:38,1209623,http://imgur.com/ZEjNdo0,"31 6:26 PM\n geez.\n 5 minutes ago\n I know Bernie's father's family was killed in\n the holocaust and he grew up poor, while\n Hillary has always lived in a rich white\n household and only got richer, but it's okay\n for me to ignore that because as a white\n middle class housewife who lives great\n without working I understand that Bernie is\n sexist and needs to check his male\n privilege.

With that, all major media organizations have done\n so as of today. What does this mean?\n Democracy died today. Bernie Sanders was America's last good chance to give up the two party system, help the\n poor, and challenge the status quo of income inequality. And what did America do with this\n chance? Spat in Bernie's\n face\n That's not to say everyone is at fault. Bernie Sanders was supported by a segment of a young generation that\n believed things could be different. This segment is the same group of young people who never gave in to all the shitty\n pop music and modern culture of dismissing serious issues\n in favor of obsessing over Kim Kardashian and Justin\n Bieber\n I am a member of this segment of the young generation. I am someone who always understood more than\n And yes\n my peers. I have a triple digit IQ and a four digit score. And I've SAT always understood politics. While other kids\n were watching ""Hannah Montana,"" I was watching the ""Daily Show"" when I was only a middle schooler\n e always\n had an instinct for politics\n n 2006, I predicted that Obama would be President before anyone else even had a clue\n who he was. It's for all these reasons that you know I'm not just bluffing when I say that Bernie Sanders was our last\n chance\n this cannot entirely be blamed just on ignorant citizens who didn't stop to learn about Bernie. It is also the\n To be fair\n amount of fraud in this election. And how do I know there has been fraud? Well, I have seen some of it firsthand\n When it was time for my state to vote in its primary, I was excited to be a part of the process. Though I could not yet\n vote, I volunteered my time as a poll watchdog, making sure nothing bad was happening. During most of the voting\n time, nothing seemed out\n of the ordinary. But I stayed late after the polls were closing. That was when I saw a black\n man messing with the consoles. I walked up and asked, ""What are you doing?"" He looked around, saw that nobody\n saying, ""I'm getting paid a lot of money to rig this. But you're a kid so nobody will\n else was there, and leaned in\n believe you anyway."" It was then that I realized just how corrupt this system is\n I'm not sure how I kept my optimism for so long. I guess I just thought even if people didn't believe Bernie, they\n would at least believe the facts. Facts like just how bad income inequality has gotten. Facts like how the American\n people haven't gotten a raise in fifty years. Facts like how the Federal Reserve steals from the poor and gives to the\n rich. And facts like how free trade agreements have led to the collapse\n not growth of a number of developing\n countries\n But despite all of this... today, democracy died. The Establishment lives. And we will all suffer\n Why did this happen? Maybe it was just ignorance. Maybe it was all the women voting with their genitals or because\n t's her turn."" Maybe it was all the African-Americans forgetting their history and who had helped them get their\n rights\n I know you're asking\n but who do you support now?! I don't know. I've seen a glimmer of hope from Jill Stein and\n Gary Johnson. But the truth I would gladly take even\n is, Trump over Clinton. Trump isn't the one under investigation\n Trump isn't the one trying to hide so many secrets. On the contrary, at least Trump is an open book. And frankly\n even if he burns this whole country down, it's probably a faster path to real progressive reform than the kind of\n neoliberal backwards incrementalism pursued by Clinton\n I would say God help us all, but God doesn't exist\n If you want\n to share this, don't hesitate\n You don't even need to credit me.

This was\n especially blatant in guatemala where Eisenhower's fucking secretary of state was on the board of directors of the United Fruit\n\n California\n H\n 4 points 17 hours ago\n not your pal\n I agree wholeheartedly. For the people that aren't quite there yet\n Bernie likes to talk about FDR. FDR had his New Deal. Same kind of stuff Bernie's platform is about. The New Deal didn't pass just\n because FDR was a nice guy. The anti-capitalist left was a powerful force back then. The communist party and the socialist parties\n were powerful. They organized the biggest union drive this country had ever and has ever seen. Millions and millions of people were\n joining unions. Many of them explicitly anti-capitalist. People were striking, marching and demonstrating every day in every city\n The New Deal was a compromise between the left and the capitalists. The government would tax the shit out of the capitalists to take\n care of the mass of people and the left would stop talking so much about the whole ""revolution"" thing. Half the capitalists agreed\n (Democrats), half didn't (the Kochs and whatnot), but it was enough. At the height of the Great Depression, when the government\n didn't have any money"", we got social security, unemployment insurance, federal jobs programs, a minimum wage, bank regulations\n 90%+ top tax bracket. All that stuff. Because they were scared of something worse. Worse for them, anyway\n So even if you aren't quite there yet with the whole socialism thing, if you want New Deal policies, a strong anti-capitalist force in\n America is very advantageous for you\n Now, I would also argue that New Deal policies aren't enough. We have evidence for that. A lot of what we gained has been lost. The\n capitalists first went after the communist party. Accused them of being anti-American, McCarthy, etc. Then they went after the\n socialists. They're the same thing as the commies, etc. Then they went after the unions. With the left highly diminished, they went to\n town on the banking regulations, welfare, etc. How did they do all these things? Money. You know, the thing that capitalists have. We\n left the very people that kind of got fucked in the New Deal (90% top tax rate), the resources (the ability to accumulate surplus value)\n to eventually undo all of the progress we made. So even if we do all the things that Bernie is talking about, eventually they will be\n undone. Been there, done that. That is why we need to democratize our workplaces. One person, one vote. Remove the capitalist\n class for good. Democratically choose our managers. Hire and fire our bosses, instead of our bosses hiring and firing us.

So\n while the idea has never been implemented super well there have been forms of similer concepts and the ideas are certainly not\n something l invented.\n permalink embed Save parent report give gold reply\n H HeyNomad Massachusetts\n 4 points 18 hours ago\n Edited to remove unnecessarily rude comment about an earlier post.

I have watched nearly all the rallies\n going all the way back to August.\n It's time to be serious though:\n This fight between FOX News and Trump over the debate has really soured me on Trump.\n It is just not presidential to behave like this. Leaders do not run away and hide like Trump is doing. It just shows\n weakness and cowardice.\n Someone deserving of the office of president needs to step up onto the stage tomorrow and defend himself and prove\n his worthiness\n This looks bad for Trump is all I am saying. It's petulent and childish behavior that is an insult to the process. It's a\n really stupid fight to engage in this close to the acual voting\n The people of Iowa are not going to react well to this. I really think Trump might have stumped himself badly.\n I can not support this and you guys shouldn't either. We need real leadership, we need real vision, and we need\n someone who can make Washington work\n Like I said, I was a Trump supporter up until this week.\n I know most of you only support Trump to act edgy and for the memes but a few of you are unironically supporting him\n and I urge you to rethink this.\n Donald Trump never says anything of substance in his rallies. No policy proposals, no legislative agenda, nothing.\n Zero\n All he does is travel from city to city to talk about himself and build his brand. It's not a real campaign. That had\n become clear this week.\n When have you ever heard Donald Trump make an actual serious policy speech? Think about it.\n Donald Trump's whole campaign is nothing but a media circus, a self-aggrandizement tour, and a way to market his\n next reality TV show. It's nothing more than that.\n Somy guys\n I'm going with Ted Cruz next month after all this bullshit Trump is pulling.

(Frankly, DNC members don't really\n represent constituencies anyway. I should know. I served on the DNC first as Executive Director and then as an\n elected member for 10 years.)\n So if we ""give"" Bernie this in the Convention's rules committee, his people will think they've ""won""\n something from the Party Establishment.

Keep complaining until you feel it's enough for then or if the mods step in.\n 3) Praise Cruz or Rubio. That is more effective than Bernie for disrupting the thread.

If they are in\n the same job, with the same level of seniority\n and experience, they are paid the same\n amount. The Equal Pay Act of 1963\n guarantees that, and made it illegal to pay\n men and women differently. This is pure\n fiction. If you know someone that has proof\n they are paid differently, send them to a\n lawyer, not a congressmen.\n 7 hours ago.
