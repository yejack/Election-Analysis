I'm totally for paying more into the system if we can\n get things like Universal Healthcare. My voting for Hillary is because she's the best and most pragmatic option to me\n in the current pool. Third party votes game-theoretically give support to the candidate you least favor. I also don't\n think either of the third party tickets pass presidential muster (though I do like Weld).\n Perhaps it's because my knowledge expands far more than just American history, but almost every year is\n significant in one way or another\n why should I instantly recognize that shitty year when you didn't even combine\n those there two numbers?\n Yeah, talking about patriotism is the big fat contextual hint there.

I'm the opposite in the fact that I know a lot about almost eve\n historical detail that has\n occurred in the last 1000 years, as well as a lot before then. Just by our very short discussion it is obvious that your\n area of expertise is very little and your only concern is voting for the Democratic party\n Sure, perhaps you are young and the only democrat you really remember is Obama. Obama is a rarity in ho\n awesome he was, comparable to some of the best presidents in the entire USA history I can see him becoming\n ranked second or third of all time. But the Democratic party hasn't always had this pure image why I'm sure that\n even you are aware of the sexual impurities that even Bill Clinton brought to the party only a couple of decades ago\n And the point of voting third party is because you like their ideas why do you only care about the candidate? With\n third party your voting for ideas until they can become more serious, because neither Gary Johnson or Jill Stein will\n become President under their current party. You're voting for a third party ticket to be a viable option for the future.\n And it doesn't give support to the candidate you least favour, what are you, simple? I am one of the belief that the\n only vote that is wasted is in a candidate and or party that you do not fully believe in. It gives support to the\n candidate that you most support. Why should anyone who doesn't fully believe in Clinton, Trump or their 'respected\n parties continue voting for the lesser of two evils?

With that, all major media organizations have done\n so as of today. What does this mean?\n Democracy died today. Bernie Sanders was America's last good chance to give up the two party system, help the\n poor, and challenge the status quo of income inequality. And what did America do with this\n chance? Spat in Bernie's\n face\n That's not to say everyone is at fault. Bernie Sanders was supported by a segment of a young generation that\n believed things could be different. This segment is the same group of young people who never gave in to all the shitty\n pop music and modern culture of dismissing serious issues\n in favor of obsessing over Kim Kardashian and Justin\n Bieber\n I am a member of this segment of the young generation. I am someone who always understood more than\n And yes\n my peers. I have a triple digit IQ and a four digit score. And I've SAT always understood politics. While other kids\n were watching ""Hannah Montana,"" I was watching the ""Daily Show"" when I was only a middle schooler\n e always\n had an instinct for politics\n n 2006, I predicted that Obama would be President before anyone else even had a clue\n who he was. It's for all these reasons that you know I'm not just bluffing when I say that Bernie Sanders was our last\n chance\n this cannot entirely be blamed just on ignorant citizens who didn't stop to learn about Bernie. It is also the\n To be fair\n amount of fraud in this election. And how do I know there has been fraud? Well, I have seen some of it firsthand\n When it was time for my state to vote in its primary, I was excited to be a part of the process. Though I could not yet\n vote, I volunteered my time as a poll watchdog, making sure nothing bad was happening. During most of the voting\n time, nothing seemed out\n of the ordinary. But I stayed late after the polls were closing. That was when I saw a black\n man messing with the consoles. I walked up and asked, ""What are you doing?"" He looked around, saw that nobody\n saying, ""I'm getting paid a lot of money to rig this. But you're a kid so nobody will\n else was there, and leaned in\n believe you anyway."" It was then that I realized just how corrupt this system is\n I'm not sure how I kept my optimism for so long. I guess I just thought even if people didn't believe Bernie, they\n would at least believe the facts. Facts like just how bad income inequality has gotten. Facts like how the American\n people haven't gotten a raise in fifty years. Facts like how the Federal Reserve steals from the poor and gives to the\n rich. And facts like how free trade agreements have led to the collapse\n not growth of a number of developing\n countries\n But despite all of this... today, democracy died. The Establishment lives. And we will all suffer\n Why did this happen? Maybe it was just ignorance. Maybe it was all the women voting with their genitals or because\n t's her turn."" Maybe it was all the African-Americans forgetting their history and who had helped them get their\n rights\n I know you're asking\n but who do you support now?! I don't know. I've seen a glimmer of hope from Jill Stein and\n Gary Johnson. But the truth I would gladly take even\n is, Trump over Clinton. Trump isn't the one under investigation\n Trump isn't the one trying to hide so many secrets. On the contrary, at least Trump is an open book. And frankly\n even if he burns this whole country down, it's probably a faster path to real progressive reform than the kind of\n neoliberal backwards incrementalism pursued by Clinton\n I would say God help us all, but God doesn't exist\n If you want\n to share this, don't hesitate\n You don't even need to credit me.
