It begins with the weakening of the\n institutions and brokers-political parties, career politicians, and congressional\n leaders and committees-that have historically held politicians accountable to\n one another and prevented everyone in the system from pursuing naked self-\n interest all the time. As these intermediaries' influence fades, politicians,\n activists, and voters all become more individualistic and unaccountable. The\n system atomizes. Chaos becomes the new normal-both in campaigns and in\n the government itself.""\n ""Like many disorders, chaos syndrome is self-reinforcing. It causes\n governmental dysfunction, which fuels public anger, which incites political\n disruption, which causes yet more governmental dysfunction.""\n Assembling power to govern a sprawling, diverse, and increasingly divided\n democracy is inevitably hard. Chaos syndrome makes it all the harder. For\n Democrats, the disorder is merely chronic; for the Republican Party, it is\n acute...

Three months in an Army TRADOC\n environment is nowhere close to representing the ""real military."" I won't be presumptuous and claim to know more\n than what I really do\n Right now, I am speaking from the point of view of a\n civilian: the people you swore an oath to defend. A millennial\n male, not yet 25 years old, who has lived in both New York City and the rural west. I have been to college, and wi\n continue my studies this fal\n semester. I believe that my views represent those of the average American young adult\n the voters, politicians, and citizens of\n the future\n When the average educated young adult thinks about the military, certain issues pop up immediately. One issue that\n has been making headlines for some time is the huge crisis of sexual assault within our armed forces\n military times.com/story/military/pentago\n 155\n When a nistic person who follows the news sees that this has been a problem for a very long time, and no\n progress is being made, he or she starts to ask questions about how much the military really cares for the well being\n of women in uniform. From my brief experience with the army, the SHARP program is treated like a joke. Nobody\n from the privates all the way up the chain of command, seems to actually give a shit about stopping sexual\n harassment and assault\n The word ""SHARP"" is treated like a joke, a mockery. And even though my experience is very\n imited, there documented evidence that sexual assault in the ""real army"" is being covered up at the highest levels\n http://warincontext.org/2013/02/27/inside-the-u-s-militarys-culture-of-sex-abuse-denial-and-cover-up/\n Another thing which a wel\n nformed person notices about the armed forces is that the racial\n religious, and political\n demographics of the military are not representative of the country. http:\n om/us-military-i\n representative-of-country- 2014-7 http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-widening-gap-between\n 158/ The south is way overrepresented in enlistment numbers. The military is far more\n republican and conservative than the public as a whole. The problem with this is manyfold. First off, the vast majority\n of the country's educated population, the thinkers and leaders of the future, come from the northeast. In contrast, the\n ess educated, more ignorant south makes up the majority of the armed forces, placing the military years behind the\n rest of the country in terms of social attitudes and progress. Also, since conservatives and the republican party are\n dying out, htt\n the cal views held by the\n majority of the military, which are already the minority in the public as a whole, will become even less representative\n of the country as a whole. A smart, educated citizen can draw no other conclusion than the fact that the military does\n not represent the people, but is an antiquated, regressive institution whose members are far too reactionary, and far\n too entrenched in the uneducated, bigoted ways of the south from where most of its members come\n Is it any wonder that fewer and fewer young americans, especially those who are we\n educated and come from modern\n and progressive regions of the country, are enlisting in the armed forces? http\n real-problem-fewer-americans-are-joining/\n I think not. The modern generation of educated young adults, the future of\n this country, is tired of the misogyny, the reactionary ideals, and the misguided political beliefs of the average service\n member\n generation is more kind, more empathetic than any previous generations\n http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/fashion/the-m\n ennials-are-generation-nice. html? r 0\n https://www\n nkedin.com/pulse/201406241 32305-171417-why-m\n ennials will-be-more-empathetic-leaders My\n generation is more educated than any previous generations: http\n culture/2015/08/m\n All of these stand in direct contrast to the\n most\n far-right politics, violent purpose, and extreme sociopathy so prevalent in our redneck dominated armed forces. You\n can try to deny it or bury your head in the sand as much as you want.

Since 1971, he\n has been Chairman of The Trump Organization, which is the principal holding company for his real estate ventures and other\n business interests. He is also the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party in the 2016 presidential election.\n Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Having worked in his father Fred Trump's real\n estate and construction firm\n while attending college, he assumed control of that family business in 1971, later renaming it\n The Trump\n Organization. During his career, Trump has built hotels, casinos, golf courses, the Manhattan neighborhood Riverside South and\n numerous other developments, many of which bear his name, including Trump Entertainment Resorts (now owned by Carl Icahn). He\n has made the Trump name a valuable and distinct brand. His name appears on such iconic brands as Trump Vodka, Trump Steaks\n and the Trump Shuttle. He briefly sought the Reform Party's nomination in the 2000 presidential election, withdrawing prior to any\n primary contests, although he won two primaries after his withdrawal. Listed by Forbes among the wealthiest 400 of The World's\n Billionaires. Trump and his businesses, as well as his three marriages, have for decades received prominent media exposure. He\n hosted The Apprentice, a popular reality television show on NBC, from 2004 to 2015\n On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican, and quickly emerged as the front-runner for his\n party's nomination. His platform includes measures to combat illegal immigration, opposition to many free-trade agreements that he\n regards as unfair, often non-interventionist views on foreign policy, and a proposal to temporarily ban immigration to the United State\n from countries with a proven history of terrorism against the United States, until the government has perfected its ability to screen out\n potential terrorists. His statements in interviews and at campaign rallies have often been controversial. with the rallies sometimes\n accompanied by protests or riots\n Trump won the highest number of states and votes in the primaries, culminating with a victory in Indiana on May 3, whereupon his\n remaining Republican rivals suspended their campaigns, and Republican chairman Reince Priebus declared him to be the party's\n presumptive nominee. Several weeks later, on May 26, the Associated Press reported that Trump had earned the 1.237 delegates\n needed to secure the nomination\n fascism\n d Trump\n Trump at a town hall meeting in Derry, Ne\n Hampshire, August 2015\n Born\n Donald John Trump\n June 14, 1946 (age 70)\n Queens, New York City, U.S\n Residence Trump Tower, Manhattan, New\n York City, U.S\n Education\n Kew-Forest Schoo\n New York Military Academy",FULLCOMMUNISM,imgur,06/25/16 1:50,1038873,http://imgur.com/uLRNpYR,"46 YOUR DAILY BREAK\n FRIDAY, JUNE 24\n THE DAILY TIMES\n ADVICE\n Free food and inlermel keep son from fully moving out\n DEAR ABBY My 21-year-\n comfortable the\n ng them for their gener\n If she's If they would come to\n provided they act like good first time recently (she was\n osity, ask your in-laws wh\n visit with me way she is, don't push her.\n they arranged the fund.\n just hang.\n instead\n guests while they're gloves) and she\n you that\n that way.\n Then describe for there\n wearing walks If she indicates to the\n ing around\n what that means, them\n freaked out!

Honestly, some of these conversations\n with my male friend felt violent, and as Solnit also explains, violence is used to control women. This is really a gender issue, and what is it that causes males to become so\n iolent\n I will just list a few of the facts Solnit discusses: A woman is beaten every 9 seconds. Women worldwide ages 15 44 are more likely to die or be maimed because of male\n violence than because of cancer, malaria, war, and traffic accidents COMBINED. Three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses. It is the main cause of death\n for pregnant women in the U.S. In the U.S. a rape is reported every 6.2 minutes, unreported, the estimate is 5 times as high. In most Middle Eastern countries a woman has\n no legal standing whatsoever Enough h\n The good news is that more and more men are ""getting it.""

ANIME\n SEXUALIZES WOMEN. This may just be the feminist in me, but Its still\n completely verifiable. Do you really think it's okay to sexualize\n women in any\n way possible? If you do, you need to stop the misogyny. There are many\n examples of how anime attributes a sexual role to women in Sword Art\n Online, Yugioh (even though lt's just a card), Fairytale, Death Note, Blue\n Exorcist, Tokyo MewMew, Soul Eater, Sailor Moon, Ouran Highschool\n Hostclub, and many other most popular animes. I don't bash anyone for\n watching Japanese shit films, but think of how you would feel if your gender\n was displayed as erotic commercial, boys. Girls, think of how your sex is\n really being evoked\n Like Comment\n a Share\n You do know there is some anime that sexualizes\n men too right.

Like, I really have fallen in love with a short 12 episode anime called\n Punch Line."" Long story short, the main character can ""U\n ber\n fy"" and gain\n superhuman powers by looking a girl's panties. It's a joke that should not be\n taken serious as its for giggles.\n I understand a lot ofanimes ""sexualize"" women,\n sexualizing the characters are sometimes to give them more ""character to that\n character, make a joke, or simply because being sexy is what the anime is\n shooting for. So, my ending statement for this topic is... that Yes, anime\n sexualizes women, but it also happens to men almost as equal if you haven't\n seen it already, and is usually for appealing looks or a simple joke.\n Like Reply -O 2 July 28, 2015 at 11:50am\n I love anime myself.

That's\n why anime is allowed to sexualize either gender lfthe anime uses sexualizing a\n gender to make a character, or some type of point/joke, then by all means, use it.\n There are animes that focus on brutal murders, selfharm, gore, and other things\n that we don't like, and that aren't right in reality.

This was\n especially blatant in guatemala where Eisenhower's fucking secretary of state was on the board of directors of the United Fruit\n\n California\n H\n 4 points 17 hours ago\n not your pal\n I agree wholeheartedly. For the people that aren't quite there yet\n Bernie likes to talk about FDR. FDR had his New Deal. Same kind of stuff Bernie's platform is about. The New Deal didn't pass just\n because FDR was a nice guy. The anti-capitalist left was a powerful force back then. The communist party and the socialist parties\n were powerful. They organized the biggest union drive this country had ever and has ever seen. Millions and millions of people were\n joining unions. Many of them explicitly anti-capitalist. People were striking, marching and demonstrating every day in every city\n The New Deal was a compromise between the left and the capitalists. The government would tax the shit out of the capitalists to take\n care of the mass of people and the left would stop talking so much about the whole ""revolution"" thing. Half the capitalists agreed\n (Democrats), half didn't (the Kochs and whatnot), but it was enough. At the height of the Great Depression, when the government\n didn't have any money"", we got social security, unemployment insurance, federal jobs programs, a minimum wage, bank regulations\n 90%+ top tax bracket. All that stuff. Because they were scared of something worse. Worse for them, anyway\n So even if you aren't quite there yet with the whole socialism thing, if you want New Deal policies, a strong anti-capitalist force in\n America is very advantageous for you\n Now, I would also argue that New Deal policies aren't enough. We have evidence for that. A lot of what we gained has been lost. The\n capitalists first went after the communist party. Accused them of being anti-American, McCarthy, etc. Then they went after the\n socialists. They're the same thing as the commies, etc. Then they went after the unions. With the left highly diminished, they went to\n town on the banking regulations, welfare, etc. How did they do all these things? Money. You know, the thing that capitalists have. We\n left the very people that kind of got fucked in the New Deal (90% top tax rate), the resources (the ability to accumulate surplus value)\n to eventually undo all of the progress we made. So even if we do all the things that Bernie is talking about, eventually they will be\n undone. Been there, done that. That is why we need to democratize our workplaces. One person, one vote.

Was it bad that the leftist\n American fighters in the Spanish Civil War were the 'Abraham Lincoln Brigade'? Is it bad that in\n Venezuela the revolution uses the image of Simon Bolivar? Is it bad that Hillary Clinton has a\n strong support base of black people because of the image they have of Bill Clinton whereas the\n republican base has abandoned Jeb Bush's attempt to use the legacy of George Bush? ls it\n bad that people think Kurt Cobain is a genius whereas the countless bands that mimic him are\n inferior All of these are forms of a ""cult of personality' once we remove the mysticism and\n propagandistic function of the words.

Since the days of Teddy Roosevelt,\n principled man who left your party in disgust, your party went from being the\n movement that stood up to Captains of Industry on behalf of the Little Guy to\n becoming whores for Big Oil, Big Pharma and Big Agribusiness. In the 1950s\n your party became the party of McCarthyist paranoia\n seeing communists\n everywhere and, in the 1960s, the GoP went from being the party that ended\n slavery to the party of race identity politics and outright racism going from the\n party of conservation to the party of pollution and science denying in Jesus'\n name along the way.\n It's worth noting that since Joseph McCarthy was condemned by his fellow US\n Senators in 1954 the GOP has gone from hunting down illusory communists\n working at The Voice of America in the State Department and in the United\n States Army to openly inviting Vladimir Putin, the former KGB counter\n intelligence officer and current Czar of all the Russias, to interfere in the election\n of the next American president.\n All those years you spent firing up the white working class voter might have kept\n you safe from a demagogue like Trump who has\n used the anger of the\n disillusioned people to remake the party ofAmerican conservatism into an\n overtly racist, xenophobic and nationalistic populist movement if only you had\n done something for them. Instead you promised them that if we only gave rich\n people more and more tax breaks they too would become welkto-do\n The thing about trickle down is that it doesn't. The mob you've been riling up\n for over half a decade sees that now.\n You ignored your own advice to embrace minorities, implement immigration\n reform, end corporate welfare and figure out what direction the people outside\n your own political base, specifically younger people, actually want this country\n to go in. Instead of embracing your own suggestions in the Growth a\n Opportunity Project you did the opposite and you wound up with Donald Trump\n You've lost the Culture Wars with your god, guns, gays and gynecology bullshit\n and now it's time for your movement to limp off into the woods to die while\n Trump takes what's left of the Republican Party and takes his seat at the head\n of the untenable alt right party that replaces it with Breitbart's Bannon and Fox\n Ailes as his Klaus Barbie and Goebbels respectively\n Thanks for ending slavery and the trust busting stuff Make sure you turn off the\n lights after tonight's debate",1.74342E+14,facebook,110/19/16 3:11,2971541,https://facebook.com/276404442375280/posts/1530450753637303,CON\n THE PATH\n TO\n PLUTOCRACY\n DESTROYING AMERICA'S PROMISE\n FISCAL YEAR 2012\n Republican ldeological Plot to Turn\n the NEW DEAL created Middle Chss\n Into Serfs\n Republicans Pee\n America's\n Back & Insists\n That it's Trickling\n RepublicanDirtyTricks.com,2.76404E+14,facebook,110/18/16 7:26,3208277,https://facebook.com/356232221111943/posts/1071691142899377,"Google the following term\n and sign up!\n ection Boardm\n Even if they say it's too late and they don't\n need help, stick around and learn the processes.\n You can lend a hand and volunteer\n Document illegal activities and monitor ballots.\n Use your phone to capture video of suspicious people\n and people blocking and challenging the votes of people.\n They are Republican operatives.\n MAKE VIDEOS OF HOW VOTES\n ARE TABULATED.\n Call 1-866- OUR-VOTE\n (1-866-687-8683)",3.56232E+14,facebook,110/17/16 15:56,2843195,https://facebook.com/191347034310951/posts/1000558103389836,TRUMP FOOD INDUSTRIES\n EVANGELICAL CONSERVATROLL\n FAST FOOD\n product of China\n Prepackaged communion\n REPUBLICAN MEMES,1.91347E+14,facebook,110/17/16 15:54,2843207,https://facebook.com/191347034310951/posts/1000556866723293,WHEN I'M PRESIDENT\n EVERYONE WILL BE REQUIRED\n TO BUY ONE OF THESE\n REPUBLICAN MEMES,1.91347E+14,facebook,110/17/16 15:39,2843108,https://facebook.com/191347034310951/posts/1000542563391390,HALLOWEEN!\n HAP Y REPUBLICAN MEMES,1.91347E+14,facebook,110/17/16 14:39,2843980,https://facebook.com/473642812704371/posts/1135694733165839,"Democratic Socialism made Sweden\n one of the greatest countries to live in,\n far above the U.S. in education,\n healthcare, wages and social justice.\n REPUBLICAN 300\n Morgan Odman\n But hey,\n what do we know?",4.73643E+14,facebook,110/17/16 8:16,2848755,https://facebook.com/1612685469059157/posts/1683949335266103,Democratic Party\n Republican Party\n DX Cocktail Party,1.61269E+15,facebook,110/17/16 5:10,2850272,https://facebook.com/281811858501064/posts/1496107700404801,"TOTAL FRAUD\n POINT COUNTER POINT\n He has destroyed\n every business\n he has managed\n He lost $905 million\n in just one year.\n He is known among\n billionaires as a\n con-artist.

Like it says on the sidebar l'm\n 22, Male-to-Female transgender polytheist, and a very enthusiastic supporter\n of Donald J.

Id consider myself a moderate\n member of the Alt Right. I believe in national pride, law and order, and national\n security above all, and believe that we as Americans have a right to protect\n our identity and our way of life. I tend to find myself balancing on the thin line\n between populism and traditionalism, between revolutionary right and the\n aristocratic reaction, so I don't really have a specific ideology m affiliated\n with. I'm a lifelong registered Republican, but I plan to quit the party if Trump\n doesn't get the nomination.\n Religiously l believe in the Old Gods of Northern Europe don't have much\n love for nature though, and I don't believe in the mystical trappings that\n normally surround these Gods (magic, spirits, ancestor worship, etc) so I don't\n consider myself a pagan just a polytheist. believe these Gods are real\n l\n pray to them, and there my religion stops.\n Despite how it sometimes seems on this blog, l do have interests outside of\n Donald Trump and his awe inspiring majesty. I'm\n hugely into science fiction.\n My favorite franchise is Fallout. I've played every single game except\n Brotherhood of Steel, and own way too much merch. I've recently started to get\n into the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and when my finances are a little\n stronger want to start playing the game. also love anime, cosplaying, and\n I'm (slowly) teaching myself how to code.

Given\n this registration, the popular vote should be extremely close.\n Our top-level findings are:\n Hillary's popularity numbers have crashed to fatal levels at 17-72 (11%\n undecided).\n 2.

Thus our delegates were bound to a person who\n wasn't running. With all the twists and turns in this election cycle, l for one, am\n glad that our delegates were notbound to someone who is no longer\n running. This is one of the advantages of the current caucus system we have.\n Yes, we had a straw poll, but our county overwhelming voted for Cruz versus\n Trump in a two-to-one ratio. So first, our delegates' voted not their personal\n favorite, but did their civic duty representing their county's wishes. Second,\n Cruz had a ground game in Colorado and courted the state delegates. This is\n perfectly within the rules and the Trumpster could have done the same, but\n lacked the will and the organization.
