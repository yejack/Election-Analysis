I\n as loading up the dishwasher with dirty dishes after lunch, and looked\n briefly up at him, sleeves rolled, hair tied up in a messy bun, an apron\n danging lazily from my neck\n ""Here,"" he said, and awkwardly thrust his dishes my way for me to clean\n before loping back upstairs.\n I looked at his retreating back and felt sad\n Dad washes his own dishes when he's alone, but when Mom is in the kitchen\n he leaves them in the sink for her. It's that age-old talked-to-death misogyny\n that division of labor that fails to value women's work. that makes women\n ork with dishes and sweeping and cleaning and taking care of men's\n emotions and everything under the sun sans paycheck but work\n nonetheless\n Dad told me this morning that he was fine treating me the same way. Maybe\n three years ago I would have called it a victory, Dad is treating me like a\n oman, ten points to baby trans Lily But it's with a bittersweet feeling that l\n grudgingly accept Dad's misogyny as a replacement for his toxic fatherhood\n from his eldest son and the pride of his life to his\n something, his child'\n (he can't bring himself to use gendered Words around me) that let him down\n to a convenient second set of hands to clean up after his mess\n But Mom is happy, at least, and that's why I'm okay with all this. Okay with\n filling the emptiness in my mother with small talk as we clean the kitchen\n conspiratorial laughter against the men of the family, the warmth of\n community, any community where she had none before. It feels to me like\n e are surviving men together. It feels like she is teaching me to weather\n their verbal blows and l am teaching her that her work is important to\n someone, and I wish neither of us had to learn these lessons but\n Here we are. I guess\n I don't know if my father will ever come around\n know his story now, the\n intergenerational trauma that created his masculinity, the American Dream\n he fixated on and gave away his vulnerability for. My contact info on his\n phone is an old picture from when I was thirteen, with my dead name\n proudly entered next to it, when I call him he picks up his phone expecting to\n speak to the past. It all makes me sad, but that's where we are. Hurting\n broken family, moving forward together. Someho",TumblrInAction,imgur,0
