I'm the opposite in the fact that I know a lot about almost eve\n historical detail that has\n occurred in the last 1000 years, as well as a lot before then. Just by our very short discussion it is obvious that your\n area of expertise is very little and your only concern is voting for the Democratic party\n Sure, perhaps you are young and the only democrat you really remember is Obama. Obama is a rarity in ho\n awesome he was, comparable to some of the best presidents in the entire USA history I can see him becoming\n ranked second or third of all time. But the Democratic party hasn't always had this pure image why I'm sure that\n even you are aware of the sexual impurities that even Bill Clinton brought to the party only a couple of decades ago\n And the point of voting third party is because you like their ideas why do you only care about the candidate? With\n third party your voting for ideas until they can become more serious, because neither Gary Johnson or Jill Stein will\n become President under their current party. You're voting for a third party ticket to be a viable option for the future.\n And it doesn't give support to the candidate you least favour, what are you, simple? I am one of the belief that the\n only vote that is wasted is in a candidate and or party that you do not fully believe in. It gives support to the\n candidate that you most support.

Many historians believe that what happened to Rome is inevitable in\n the US and the west, that's why they view the rise of Trump so seriously. That the problem with democracy is that it\n ll eventually collapse into monarchy again. The more power is concentrated in a few hands, the more likely another\n Ceasar is to show up.\n The difference between us, and Rome, is that our modem state has the capacity to do something about it. The\n problem is that we won't. Today, advanced westem countries understand that the only completely preventable natural\n disaster is being struck by a giant rock from outer space. The US has given NASA a mandate, and the budget, to find\n and catalog all of these suckers. Tod\n we know and are tracking 90% of the NEOs that are in the ""dinosaur killer\n class, that's a huge improvement. While most of the smaller fry, that could level countries and cities, are still not\n known and smaller objects are harder to find\n we live in a time where the prospect of another dinosaur killer hitting\n us without us having advance waming is growing very small. I point this out to demonstrate what democracy is good\n at. Adam's law of slow moving disasters states that any disaster that we see with sufficient warning time will be\n prevented\n So, what about the disaster posed by a Ceasar? In our modem world, there is absolutely no reason why we can't\n prevent a ceasar However, the biggest edge that Ceasar has in coming to power is the dividedness of the people. Only\n a divided nation can yield way to a dictator People on one side don't even understand the language the other side is\n speaking. That's a major problem\n Take the issue of guns. I'm not a gun owner. I've never held a gun in my hands. I tend to vote democrat. I in the\n live ilicon valley, one of the most left-wing places in the nation. The only time I've ever seen a gun is behind the counter\n hen\n I\n walk into the sporting goods store. Despite all that, I strongly support gun rights\n as an intellectual matter I\n believe in the rule of law, and the second amendment is not going anywhere. America has\n always had mass\n shootings, but for over 200 years, we had a second amendment and mass shootings were not a big enough problem\n that they led to a discussion on gun control.

Solnit explains how this has silenced many young women in the same way as being harassed on\n the street. l found myself thinking of a male friend of\n mine. We've had many discussions, as he is Republican, and I, Democrat. There were so many times when he would\n explain things to me,"" and l would feel intimidated.

Honestly, some of these conversations\n with my male friend felt violent, and as Solnit also explains, violence is used to control women. This is really a gender issue, and what is it that causes males to become so\n iolent\n I will just list a few of the facts Solnit discusses: A woman is beaten every 9 seconds. Women worldwide ages 15 44 are more likely to die or be maimed because of male\n violence than because of cancer, malaria, war, and traffic accidents COMBINED. Three women a day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses. It is the main cause of death\n for pregnant women in the U.S. In the U.S. a rape is reported every 6.2 minutes, unreported, the estimate is 5 times as high. In most Middle Eastern countries a woman has\n no legal standing whatsoever Enough h\n The good news is that more and more men are ""getting it.""

For\n example the US and UK backed coup in Iran was done because the nationalization of oil threatened corporate profits. This was\n especially blatant in guatemala where Eisenhower's fucking secretary of state was on the board of directors of the United Fruit\n\n California\n H\n 4 points 17 hours ago\n not your pal\n I agree wholeheartedly. For the people that aren't quite there yet\n Bernie likes to talk about FDR. FDR had his New Deal. Same kind of stuff Bernie's platform is about. The New Deal didn't pass just\n because FDR was a nice guy. The anti-capitalist left was a powerful force back then. The communist party and the socialist parties\n were powerful. They organized the biggest union drive this country had ever and has ever seen. Millions and millions of people were\n joining unions. Many of them explicitly anti-capitalist. People were striking, marching and demonstrating every day in every city\n The New Deal was a compromise between the left and the capitalists. The government would tax the shit out of the capitalists to take\n care of the mass of people and the left would stop talking so much about the whole ""revolution"" thing. Half the capitalists agreed\n (Democrats), half didn't (the Kochs and whatnot), but it was enough. At the height of the Great Depression, when the government\n didn't have any money"", we got social security, unemployment insurance, federal jobs programs, a minimum wage, bank regulations\n 90%+ top tax bracket. All that stuff. Because they were scared of something worse. Worse for them, anyway\n So even if you aren't quite there yet with the whole socialism thing, if you want New Deal policies, a strong anti-capitalist force in\n America is very advantageous for you\n Now, I would also argue that New Deal policies aren't enough. We have evidence for that. A lot of what we gained has been lost. The\n capitalists first went after the communist party. Accused them of being anti-American, McCarthy, etc. Then they went after the\n socialists. They're the same thing as the commies, etc. Then they went after the unions. With the left highly diminished, they went to\n town on the banking regulations, welfare, etc. How did they do all these things? Money. You know, the thing that capitalists have. We\n left the very people that kind of got fucked in the New Deal (90% top tax rate), the resources (the ability to accumulate surplus value)\n to eventually undo all of the progress we made. So even if we do all the things that Bernie is talking about, eventually they will be\n undone. Been there, done that. That is why we need to democratize our workplaces. One person, one vote. Remove the capitalist\n class for good. Democratically choose our managers. Hire and fire our bosses, instead of our bosses hiring and firing us.

Several times in modern history, the idea of workers' councils has been attributed to similar forms of\n organization, although in most cases the workers didn't actually have full power control and were subdued to some external authority.\n Examples include Russia in 1905 and 1917, where councils were called ""soviets""; Germany during 1918 (Rate); Poland in 1905, 1918\n and 1956 (rady robotnicze); Turin, Italy during 1919-1920; rural lreland during 1920-1921; China during 1926-1927; Spain during\n 1936; Hungary during 1919 and 1956, France during 1871 and 1968, Chile in 1973 (cordones\n ran during 1978-1979 (shoras).
